# Spotify Listening Analysis 🎧

This project analyzes a user's Spotify listening history and compares it with global Spotify audio feature averages to identify listening preferences.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand whether a user's music taste differs from global Spotify trends by comparing key audio features:

* **Energy**
* **Danceability**
* **Valence**

The analysis answers the question:
**"How does this user's music listening behavior differ from the global Spotify audience?"**

---

## 📂 Datasets Used

* **User Listening History**
  Contains track names and artists listened to by the user.

* **Spotify Tracks Dataset**
  Includes global Spotify tracks with detailed audio features such as energy, danceability, and valence.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data cleaning, merging, and analysis
* **Matplotlib** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🔍 Data Processing Steps

1. Cleaned and standardized track and artist names (lowercase normalization).
2. Merged user listening data with Spotify audio features using track name and artist.
3. Calculated average audio feature values for:

   * User listening history
   * Global Spotify dataset
4. Compared results using a bar chart visualization.

---

## 📊 Analysis Results

The comparison shows that the user's listening preferences are consistently **higher than global averages** in:

* Energy
* Danceability
* Valence

This suggests that the user prefers **more energetic, danceable, and emotionally positive music** compared to the general Spotify audience.

---

## 📈 Visualization

A bar chart is used to compare user averages against global Spotify averages for selected audio features.

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical example of exploratory data analysis using real-world data.
It highlights how simple data processing and visualization techniques can uncover meaningful insights about user behavior.

---

## 📎 Future Improvements

* Include additional audio features (tempo, acousticness, speechiness)
* Analyze listening behavior by genre
* Expand analysis with time-based trends
